GymMode
================================================================================

Beginner-friendly Northstar server mod, where your maximum HP adjusts at every kill and death.

If a match has only beginners or average players in it,
most players will float around 80-140 HP.
If a veteran player joins the match, others get more HP after deaths,
while the veteran player can end up with very low HP.
This means the beginners can still practice the game,
while the veteran player has to practice better movement to avoid dying,
and better aim to kill the high-HP enemies.

Default settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * You start from 100 HP
  * A kill at 100 HP or below reduces your HP by 10 points
  * A kill at above 100 HP reduces your HP by 20 points
  * A death at 100 HP or above increases your HP by 20 points
  * A death at below 100 HP increases your HP by 10 points
  * Maximum HP can go up to 200 or down to 10

See `mod.json` if you want to change these values.
